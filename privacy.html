  <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
  <p><b>Effective Date: June 25, 2015</b></p>
  <p>Extended Mind values your privacy in your personal information and your Content that you store in our beta version of the service (the "Service"). This Privacy Policy explains what information Extended Mind Technologies Oy and its affiliated companies (together, "Extended Mind" or "we" and sometimes "us") collect about you and why, what we may do with that information and how we handle your Content.</p>
  <h4>Scope Of Privacy Policy</h4>
  <p>This Privacy Policy is incorporated into the Extended Mind Terms and Conditions of Use for Beta Version ("Beta Terms"), and applies to the information obtained by us through your use of this website, the Service and other Extended Mind products and services. Capitalized terms used in this Privacy Policy and not otherwise defined shall have the meanings provided for those terms in the Beta Terms.</p>
  <h4>Changes To Privacy Policy</h4>
  <p>As Extended Mind evolves, we may need to update this Policy to keep pace with changes in the Service, our business and laws applicable to us and you; we will, however, always maintain our commitment to respect your privacy. We will post any revisions to this Policy, along with their effective date, in an easy to find area of our web site, so we recommend that you periodically check back here to stay informed of any changes. We will ask for your consent to such changes if required by applicable law; in other cases, please note that your continuation of your Extended Mind Service account after any change means that you agree with, and consent to be bound by, the new Privacy Policy. If you disagree with any changes in this Policy and do not wish your information to be subject to the revised Policy, you will need to close your account.</p>

  <h4>Underage Users</h4>
  <p>Extended Mind will notify and obtain consent from a parent or guardian before we collect, use and disclose the personal information of children who are under 13 years of age. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13 years of age without such consent and, if we learn that we have inadvertently done so, we will promptly delete it. </p>

  <p>We need to do so in connection with the sale or reorganization of all or part of our business, as permitted by applicable law. </p>

  <p>When you use Extended Mind software on your computing device, such as by using one of our downloadable clients, Content you save will be stored locally on that device. When you synch your computing device with the Service, that Content will be replicated on our servers, which are located in the European Union.</p>
  <p>Please be aware that Personal Information and Content submitted to Extended Mind will be transferred to a data center in the European Union. If you post information to the Extended Mind sites you are confirming your consent to such information, including Personal Information and Content, being hosted and accessed in the European Union.</p>

  <p>Users who wish to (i) access any Personal Information that we hold about you; (ii) request that we correct or delete the Personal Information that we hold about you; or (iii) request that we not use or stop using your Personal Information for marketing purposes may do so by contacting us at <a href="mailto:info@ext.md">info@ext.md</a>. We will comply with such requests to the extent permitted or required by law.</p>
  <p>Extended Mind complies with the laws of Finland and the European Union regarding the collection, use and retention of personal information collected from users.</p>
  <h4>Security Of Data</h4>
  <p>Extended Mind is committed to protecting the security of your information and takes reasonable precautions to protect it. However, Internet data transmissions, whether wired or wireless, cannot be guaranteed to be 100% secure, and as a result, we cannot ensure the security of information you transmit to us; accordingly, you acknowledge that you do so at your own risk. Once we receive your data transmission, we make all commercially reasonable efforts to ensure its security on our systems:</p>
  <p>Your Extended Mind password is protected by encryption, and only you have access to it.</p>
  <p>Certain Extended Mind services support the use of standard SSL encryption to protect data transmissions. However, this is not a guarantee that such data transmissions cannot be accessed, altered or deleted due to firewall or other security software failures.</p>
  <p>If Extended Mind learns of a security system breach, we may attempt to notify you and provide information on protective steps, if available, through the email address that you have provided to us or by posting a notice on our web site. Depending on where you live, you may have a legal right to receive such notices in writing.</p>
  <h3>IV. Information Deletion</h3>
  <h4>Ending Usage of Extended Mind</h4>
  <p>You can delete Content you have posted at any time, and you can stop using the Extended Mind Service at any time. If you delete information and material, it will no longer be accessible to you or others who may access the Service, but residual copies of your deleted Content may continue to exist on the Extended Mind Service’s back-up and archiving systems for up to one year due to the nature of those systems’ operations. If you cancel your account, the Content in your account will be maintained for thirty (30) days and then deleted unless you purposely delete that information beforehand, and sync your account before you cancel your account. </p>
  <h4>Closure Of Account By Extended Mind</h4>
  <p>If Extended Mind closes your Service account due to a Beta Terms violation, then you may contact Extended Mind to request deletion of your data, and Extended Mind will evaluate such requests on a case by case basis, pursuant to our legal obligations.</p>
